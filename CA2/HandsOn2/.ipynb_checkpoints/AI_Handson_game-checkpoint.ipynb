    "Once we've seen some of the lefthand children of a node, this gives us a preliminary value for that node. For a max node, this is a lower bound on the value at the node. For a min node, this gives us an upper bound. Therefore, as we start to look at additional children, we can abandon the exploration once it becomes clear that the new child can't beat the value that we're currently holding.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the left-to-right order of nodes matters to the performance of alpha-beta pruning. See this example (from Mitch Marcus (U. Penn), adapted from Rick Lathrop (USC)). Remember that the tree is built dynamically, so this left-to-right ordering is determined by the order in which we consider the various possible actions (moves in the game).\n",

    "Suppose that we have b moves in each game state (i.e. branching factor b), and our tree has height m. Then standard minimax examines O(bm) nodes. If we visit the nodes in the optimal order, alpha-beta pruning will reduce the number of nodes searched to O(bm/2). If we visit the nodes in random order, we'll examine O(b3m/4) on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we can't magically arrange to have the nodes in exactly the right order. However, heuristic ordering of actions can get close to the optimal O(b^{m/2}) in practice. For example, a good heuristic order for chess examines possible moves in the following order:\n",
