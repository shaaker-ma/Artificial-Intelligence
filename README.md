# Artificial-Intelligence
 This repository contains both descriptions of the projects and my codes for Artificial-Intelligence course held at the University of Tehran.


CA0 : 
	- In this project we are going to predict a target which in this case is price of 
          some models of cars using regression, we will compare the difference between the 
	  result using "sklearn" and without using it.

CA1 :
	-In this project we are going to use "Search algorithms" to find the most optimum 
	 solution to a specific search problem.In this project, we learn how to implement 
	 both Informed and Uninformed search strategies in a problem of "Maze", Then we will
	 examine the implementations and compare them in different ways. 
	 
	 We are  going to use "BFS", "IDS", "A*", and  "Weighted A*" assuming some condition
	 that problem has stated.
          
CA2:
	- Hands On 1: In this Hands-On we used "Genetic Algorithm" made an optimum schedual 
		      for a hospital which is currently conflicted and faced Corona-Virus.

	- Hands On 2: In this project we are going to use Arversarial-Game algorithems and try 
                      to make an agent that would win most of the times in a BlackJack game.

CA3:
	-In this project we are going to use "Naive Bayes" to build a classifier model to predict
	 the category of a book using a description and name of the book.

CA4:
	-In this project we are going to use "scikit-library" to perform machine learning algorithms 
	 on given data so that we can fit a model to estimate each vehicle's price.
	 Used:
		- Preprocessing and Natural Language Processing before estimation.
		- KNN Method
		- Linear Regression
		- Decision Tree
		- Random Forest

CA5: 
	- Phase1: Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks and do a classification task
	- Phase2: Using TensorFlow to implement a Feed Forward Neural Network and train the NN 
		  to do a classification task using UTKFace Dateset
